#### I said I liked conservation on the home page, so I decided to make this about a part of nature I really like...

# TREES!!!

(I mean, come on, just look at that, how could you not like it?)



Anyways, I'm a big fan of trees, because I've learned all about how tree roots form complex, symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi... 

and how *really* tall trees like redwoods push the tensile strength of their water column to its absolute limit but somehow avoid embolism... 

and how trees are vitally important to types of sustainable coffee farming (which is personally quite important, as I **love** coffee)... 

and how the mechanism of water transport in trees is oddly comparable to sucking a milkshake through a straw (weird way to think about it, but it's true)...

and yet still, when I see a really cool tree, the first thought in my head is always:



```{r}
#a little bit of R
library(reticulate)
tree<-"WOW,"
```
and then...
```{python}
#a little bit of python
tree="IT'S A TREE"
```
and finally, all together...
```{python}
#a little bit of both
print(r.tree,tree) 
```

# Wow, it's a tree indeed...

#### It's the simple things.

I suppose trees are kind of similar to coding languages. They're complex, constantly developing and growing, and I like them a lot better when I don't have to think too much about them :)

### So that was trees as described by R and python... and now... MORE TREES!

Look at those roots! WOW!

I don't even know what's happening with this one, but wow.

This one is actually all one organism (FREAKING WOWWWWWWWW!!)

### Okay, that is all :)
