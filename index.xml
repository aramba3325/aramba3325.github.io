      <description>I said I liked conservation on the home page, so I decided to make this about a part of nature I really like…  TREES!!! (I mean, come on, just look at that, how could you not like it?)
Anyways, I’m a big fan of trees, because I’ve learned all about how tree roots form complex, symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi…
and how really tall trees like redwoods push the tensile strength of their water column to its absolute limit but somehow avoid embolism…</description>

      <description>Intro I chose to use the drinks dataset (from fivethirtyeight) and the countries_of_the_world dataset (from kaggle). Both have information about countries (both listed the country name as a variable), which made it easy to join, but the had very different statistics, which made it interesting. The drinks dataset had data about alcohol consumption in each country, while the countries_of_the_world dataset had more normal information (Population, GDP, Birthrate, Deathrate, etc.</description>
